1. Set up Pulumi and AWS access as explained on the [tutorial](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/aws/begin/)
2. Checkout this GitHub repository
3. Create and activate a python environment based on the `requirements.txt`
4. Login to your preferred Pulumi [backend](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/state/)

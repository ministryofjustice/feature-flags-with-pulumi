# Feature Flags (AKA Toggles) with Pulumi

[Feature flags](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html) (also known as feature toggles) is a software engineering design pattern which helps to release code to production more quickly and often while maintaining a single source code branch. This repository explains how to implement feature flags with [Pulumi](https://www.Pulumi.com/) [infrastructure-as-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) projects using the Pulumi [configuration](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/config/) system.
